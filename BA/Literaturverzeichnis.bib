 abstract = {Air curtains are created in open refrigerated vertical display cases for creating an invisible barrier between the cold air inside and the warm air outside the case. A systematic approach is developed to minimize the entrainment and infiltration of warm air into the case by optimizing the performance of an air curtain through adjusting pertinent flow parameters and case geometry. A modular display case was manufactured for the parametric studies. In this modular display case the geometry and flow parameters were changed and the infiltration rate was measured using a new technique, tracer gas method, which could be performed noticeably faster than the conventional methods. This apparatus is referred to as the proof-of-concept air curtain (POCAC). A matrix of all possible permutations was constructed with the infiltration rate being the outcome of this matrix. This matrix was populated by actual experimental measurements as well as using validated Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) computer programs as a tool to acquire better resolution of the input and output datasets. All the problem variables are referred to as the input vector of all parameters that can be altered, and the output is the infiltration rate. An artificial neural network (ANN) program was used to provide the linkage between the input vector (problem variables) and the problem outcome (infiltration). This program can also be used by industry as a tool to estimate the infiltration rate for all existing open vertical display cases.},

@article{Ploskas.2017,
 abstract = {Optimization of the refrigerant circuitry can improve a heat exchanger's performance. Design engineers currently choose the refrigerant circuitry according to their experience and heat exchanger simulations. However, the design of an optimized refrigerant circuitry is difficult. The number of refrigerant circuitry candidates is enormous. Therefore, exhaustive search algorithms cannot be used and intelligent techniques must be developed to explore the solution space efficiently. In this paper, we formulate refrigerant circuitry design as a binary constrained optimization problem. We use CoilDesigner, a simulation and design tool of air to refrigerant heat exchangers, in order to simulate the performance of different refrigerant circuitry designs. We treat CoilDesigner as a black-box system since the exact relationship of the objective function with the decision variables is not explicit. Derivative-free optimization (DFO) algorithms are suitable for solving this black-box model since they do not require explicit functional representations of the objective function and the constraints. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we compare four mixed-integer constrained DFO solvers and one box-bounded DFO solver and evaluate their ability to solve a difficult industrially relevant problem. Second, we demonstrate that the proposed formulation is suitable for optimizing the circuitry configuration of heat exchangers. We apply the DFO solvers to 17 heat exchanger design problems. Results show that TOMLAB/glcDirect and TOMLAB/glcSolve can find optimal or near-optimal refrigerant circuitry designs after a relatively small number of circuit simulations.},

 abstract = {The refrigeration energy load in a modern day supermarket makes up a large

proportion of the total energy bilL Better design of refrigerated display cases would

reduce this load and also have a corresponding effect on the running costs of the

refrigeration plant. Further enhancements such as the reduction of air overspill from the case would also influence the aisle temperatures and therefore the comfort levels in the store.

This research project uses the technique of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to investigate the contemporary design of a vertical multideck refrigerated display case. From a two dimensional computational model conclusions were drawn as to the principles of operation of the case.

During the course of the project, a custom designed experimental facility was constructed, capable of testing the display case according to the relevant test standards. Using this facility, experimental validation was carried on a number of the design modifications to assess the actual refrigeration load against that predicted by the CFD modeL The success of this validation allowed further work into the feasibility of certain design changes by making modifications to the CFD modeL

The work presented in this thesis makes a conthbution to the global effort towards the reduction of the energy consumption by retail refrigeration systems. It does this by showing that possibilities do exist for an improvement in the energy efficiency of multideck refrigerated display cases and that CFD provides a useful tool towards this goaL It also demonstrates the design modifications which proved to yield a saving in energy. These were a reduction in the mass flow rate of air around the case, the inclusion of a honeycomb section on the air curtain outlet of the case the addition of a front upstand and the introduction of a second air curtain thus applying a velocity gradient across the curtain.},
